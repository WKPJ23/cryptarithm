# cryptarithm
Development of a cryptarithm game with GUI.

This program randomly selects a pre-determined cryptarithm, solves it using brute-force, and then prompts the user through a GUI to input their solution to check it against the program's. I chose this puzzle because I like cryptography and this seemed like a good entry point into designing a basic GUI.
